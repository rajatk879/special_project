# Speech Emotion Recogniton System
The project aims at devising a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system to effectively identify
the emotion and gender from speech signals obtained from the audios uploaded. For the purpose
of identification of the emotions from the speech, two of the main phases are Feature extraction
and modelling through the implementation of Deep Learning classifier Convolutional Neural
Network or CNN. The project goal end product is a web based SER where any audio of the
format .wav uploaded should output the gender and the emotion contained in the speech audio.
The SER system should work on audios of any length as long as the format is .wav. Two main
functionalities to be included in the Home page are 'Upload' and 'Detect'.'Upload' button gives
provision for the user to upload the audio for which the emotion needs to be detected. The audio
should be pre recorded and uploaded. Clicking upon the 'Detect' button the system provides the
user with the emotion along with the gender of the audio that has been detected from the audio
uploaded to the system through the ‘ Upload’ button. The output would be a discrete emotion
and the gender of the speaker.
